        About Crackora
      </h1>

      <div className="space-y-5 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Crackora was built with a simple belief — exam preparation should not
          feel confusing, overwhelming, or directionless. While students today
          have access to countless resources, many still struggle with clarity,
          structure, and confidence. Crackora exists to simplify that journey by
          combining smart technology, practical strategies, and real academic
          expertise.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our platform supports aspirants preparing for competitive exams such as
          CAT, GMAT, law entrances, MCA entrance examinations, and other
          aptitude-based tests. Instead of generic study advice, Crackora focuses
          on structured preparation, personalized study planning, and
          concept-driven learning tailored to individual goals and timelines.

          The Vision Behind Crackora
        </h2>

        <p>
          Crackora was founded by <strong>Mitesh Gandhi</strong>, a software
          developer and technology enthusiast with over <strong>7 years of
          experience in software development</strong>. With a strong academic
          foundation and a passion for learning systems, Mitesh envisioned a
          platform that could remove friction from exam preparation and help
          students make smarter decisions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Mitesh holds a <strong>Master of Science in Computer Science</strong>{" "}
          from <strong>Binghamton University, New York</strong>, along with an{" "}
          <strong>MSc in Advanced Computer Science with Data Science</strong>{" "}
          from <strong>University of Strathclyde, Scotland</strong>. His
          background in technology and data-driven systems plays a central role
          in Crackora’s approach to intelligent study planning and structured
          preparation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Beyond building technology, Mitesh has actively guided students
          preparing for exams including <strong>MCA entrance tests and other
          competitive examinations</strong>. His experience working closely with
          aspirants revealed a recurring challenge — students often lack not only
          preparation strategy but also clarity about what comes <em>after</em>{" "}
          the exam.
        </p>

        <p>
          This insight shaped Crackora’s broader mission: helping learners not
          just prepare for exams, but also navigate the academic and career
          decisions that follow. From understanding course choices to exploring
          career pathways, Crackora aims to support students beyond scores and
          rankings.

          <strong>Mohd Azad</strong>, an educator with more than{" "}
          <strong>10 years of teaching experience</strong>. Azad brings deep
